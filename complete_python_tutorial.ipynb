However, **kwargs differs from\\n*args in that you will need to assign keywords.\\n\\nFirst, let’s simply print out the **kwargs arguments that we pass to a function. We’ll create a short function to do \\nthis:\\nprint_kwargs.py\\n\\ndef print_kwargs(**kwargs):\\n        print(kwargs)\\n\\nNext, we’ll call the function with some keyworded arguments passed into the function:\\nprint_kwargs.py\\n\\ndef print_kwargs(**kwargs):\\n        print(kwargs)\\n\\nprint_kwargs(kwargs_1=\"Shark\", kwargs_2=4.5, kwargs_3=True)\\n\\nLet’s run the program above and look at the output:\\n\\n    python print_kwargs.py\\n\\nOutput\\n{\\'kwargs_3\\': True, \\'kwargs_2\\': 4.5, \\'kwargs_1\\': \\'Shark\\'}\\n\\nDepending on the version of Python 3 you are currently using, the dictionary data type may be unordered. In Python 3.6 \\nand above, you’ll receive the key-value pairs in order, but in earlier versions, the pairs will be output in a random \\norder.\\n\\nWhat is important to note is that a dictionary called kwargs is created and we can work with it just like we can work \\nwith other dictionaries.\\n\\nLet’s create another short program to show how we can make use of **kwargs. Here we’ll create a function to greet a \\ndictionary of names. First, we’ll start with a dictionary of two names:\\nprint_values.py\\n\\ndef print_values(**kwargs):\\n    for key, value in kwargs.items():\\n        print(\"The value of {} is {}\".format(key, value))\\n\\nprint_values(my_name=\"Sammy\", your_name=\"Casey\")\\n\\nWe can now run the program and look at the output:\\n\\n    python print_values.py\\n\\nOutput\\nThe value of your_name is Casey\\nThe value of my_name is Sammy\\n\\nAgain, because dictionaries may be unordered, your output may be with the name Casey first or with the name Sammy first.\\n\\n\\nLet’s now pass additional arguments to the function to show that **kwargs will accept however many arguments you would \\nlike to include:\\nprint_values.py\\n\\ndef print_values(**kwargs):\\n    for key, value in kwargs.items():\\n        print(\"The value of {} is {}\".format(key, value))\\n\\nprint_values(\\n            name_1=\"Alex\",\\n            name_2=\"Gray\",\\n            name_3=\"Harper\",\\n            name_4=\"Phoenix\",\\n            name_5=\"Remy\",\\n            name_6=\"Val\"\\n        )\\n\\nWhen we run the program at this point, we’ll receive the following output, which may again be unordered:\\n\\nOutput\\nThe value of name_2 is Gray\\nThe value of name_6 is Val\\nThe value of name_4 is Phoenix\\nThe value of name_5 is Remy\\nThe value of name_3 is Harper\\nThe value of name_1 is Alex\\n\\nUsing **kwargs provides us with flexibility to use keyword arguments in our program.
